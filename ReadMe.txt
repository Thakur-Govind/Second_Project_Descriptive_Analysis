This was my second project at Udacity. This was about Descriptive Statistics.
Udacity gives us the freedom to do our own projects, however we want.
So, I went ahead, and made the raw dataset myself, collecting data from Students, Teachers, and Friends
This project uses the Stroop Effect.
A link for the same: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect
In this project, I had to set a null hypothesis, and proove that it is accecpted/rejected by statisics
Of course, the calculation part was all done through coding (Computer Engineering, after all :) )
All the work, along with the coding is in a pdf file.
The project required commitment, for sure- but it was worth the efforts.
Hope you like it!
